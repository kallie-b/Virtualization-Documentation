Please note that this script was not built to check for anything that might go wrong - if you have feedback, please comment. Use at your own risk.

Requirements
------------

The demo environment can be set up on a system running Windows 10, version 1607 or Windows Server 2016.
The host has to have at least the following:
- 32 GB RAM
- 80 GB free disk space

Prerequisites
-------------

Download the sources and add them to the following directories:

| Source | Directory | Download |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| Windows Server 2016 media | C:\IgniteSource\WindowsServer2016 | [evaluation media](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016) |
| System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2016 media | C:\IgniteSource\VMMWAPDependencies\VMM | [evaluation version](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-system-center-2016) |
