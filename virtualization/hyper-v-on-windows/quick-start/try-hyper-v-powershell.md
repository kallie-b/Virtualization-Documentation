# Working with Hyper-V and Windows PowerShell

Now that you have walked through the basics of deploying Hyper-V, creating virtual machines and managing these virtual machines, letâ€™s explore how you can automate many of these activities with PowerShell.

### Return a list of Hyper-V commands

1.	Click on the Windows start button, type **PowerShell**.
2.	Run the following command to display a searchable list of PowerShell commands available with the Hyper-V PowerShell Module.

 ```powershell
Get-Command -Module hyper-v | Out-GridView
```
  You get something like this:

3. To learn more about a particular PowerShell command use `Get-Help`. For instance running the following command returns information about the `Get-VM` Hyper-V command.

  ```powershell
Get-Help Get-VM
```
 The output shows you how to structure the command, what the required and optional parameters are, and the aliases that you can use.

### Return a list of virtual machines

Use the `Get-VM` command to return a list of virtual machines.

1. In PowerShell, run the following command:
 
 ```powershell
Get-VM
```
 This displays something like this:

2. To return a list of only powered on virtual machines add a filter to the `Get-VM` command. A filter can be added by using the `Where-Object` command. For more information on filtering see the [Using the Where-Object](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee177028.aspx) documentation.   

 ```powershell
 Get-VM | where {$_.State -eq 'Running'}
 ```
3.  To list all virtual machines in a powered off state, run the following command. This command is a copy of the command from step 2 with the filter changed from 'Running' to 'Off'.

 ```powershell
 Get-VM | where {$_.State -eq 'Off'}
 ```

### Start and shut down virtual machines

1. To start a particular virtual machine, run the following command with name of the virtual machine:

 ```powershell
 Start-VM -Name <virtual machine name>
 ```

2. To start all currently powered off virtual machines, get a list of those machines and pipe the list to the `Start-VM` command:

  ```powershell
 Get-VM | where {$_.State -eq 'Off'} | Start-VM
 ```
3. To shut down all running virtual machines, run this:
 
  ```powershell
 Get-VM | where {$_.State -eq 'Running'} | Stop-VM
 ```

### Create a VM checkpoint

To create a checkpoint using PowerShell, select the virtual machine using the `Get-VM` command and pipe this to the `Checkpoint-VM` command. Finally give the checkpoint a name using `-SnapshotName`. The complete command looks like the following:

 ```powershell
 Get-VM -Name <VM Name> | Checkpoint-VM -SnapshotName <name for snapshot>
 ```
### Create a new virtual machine

The following example shows how to create a new virtual machine in the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE). This is a simple example and could be expanded on to include additional PowerShell features and more advanced VM deployments.

1. To open the PowerShell ISE click on start, type **PowerShell ISE**.
2. Run the following code to create a virtual machine. See the [New-VM](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848537.aspx) documentation for detailed information on the `New-VM` command.

  ```powershell
 $VMName = "VMNAME"

 $VM = @{
     Name = $VMName 
     MemoryStartupBytes = 2147483648
     Generation = 2
     NewVHDPath = "C:\Virtual Machines\$VMName\$VMName.vhdx"
     NewVHDSizeBytes = 53687091200
     BootDevice = "VHD"
     Path = "C:\Virtual Machines\$VMName"
     SwitchName = (Get-VMSwitch).Name[0]
 }

 New-VM @VM
  ```
