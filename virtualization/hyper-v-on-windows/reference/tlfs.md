# Hypervisor Specifications

## Hypervisor Top-Level Functional Specification

The Hyper-V Hypervisor Top-Level Functional Specification (TLFS) describes the hypervisor's externally visible behavior to other operating system components. This specification is meant to be useful for guest operating system developers.
  
> This specification is provided under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise.  Read the following for further details about the [Microsoft Open Specification Promise](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecifications).

## Requirements for Implementing the Microsoft Hypervisor Interface

Windows operating systems require a limited set of hypervisor interfaces to run in a guest virtual machine (also known as the "HV#1" interface). In addition, several optional features can be implemented by a Microsoft-compatible hypervisor. These options will change the behavior of Windows in a virtual machine. "Requirements for Implementing the Microsoft Hypervisor Interface" describes both the required and optional features that are implemented by a Microsoft-compatible hypervisor.
